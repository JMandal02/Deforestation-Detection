# 🔥 Classification of Fire Types in India Using MODIS Satellite Data (2021–2023)

**AICTE Internship – Cycle 2 Project**

This project focuses on detecting and classifying fire events across India using thermal anomaly data from NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite sensors. The classification includes vegetation fires, agricultural burns, volcanic activity, and offshore/static thermal sources.

## 📦 Model Access

Due to GitHub's file size limit (25 MB), the trained model (`best_fire_detection_model.pkl`, 460.1 MB) is hosted on Google Drive.

👉 **[Download the trained model here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ub_ktWHXdvv2kn104xwa1QrYq2Z0_DM3?usp=sharing)**


## 📌 Objective

Leverage MODIS data from **2021 to 2023** to develop a **machine learning model** that identifies the source of thermal anomalies. This is crucial for:

- 🌳 Environmental and deforestation monitoring
- 🚨 Real-time disaster response
- 📈 Data-driven resource management
- 🧪 Long-term ecological analysis

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Accurate classification**: Vegetation, volcano, static land, offshore fire types
- 🌐 **Geospatial data integration**: MODIS thermal readings with location data
- 🛰️ **Dual satellite source**: Aqua (PM) and Terra (AM) observations
- 📊 **Interactive and reproducible ML pipeline**
- 🇮🇳 **Country-specific focus**: India dataset (2021–2023)



> ✅ **For Students:** If your model file is large, upload it to Google Drive and add the link to your `README.md`, just like this example.

## 🌍 Project Overview

India experiences thousands of fire incidents annually, ranging from wildfires to agricultural burns. While MODIS provides rich thermal and geospatial data, classifying fire types remains a significant challenge.

This project addresses the challenge by:

- ✅ Preprocessing MODIS fire data (2021–2023)
- 🧠 Engineering thermal, temporal, and geospatial features
- 🤖 Training ML models to classify fire sources
- 🔁 Building a scalable and reusable ML pipeline

## 🗃️ MODIS Dataset Summary

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sensor** | MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) |
| **Satellites** | Terra (AM) and Aqua (PM) |
| **Resolution** | 1 km per pixel |
| **Frequency** | 2–4 observations per day |
| **Source** | NASA FIRMS |

## 🔍 Fire Detection Mechanism

MODIS detects thermal anomalies using contextual algorithms across multiple spectral bands:

- 🔸 **Bands 21/22** – Mid-infrared for fire detection
- 🔸 **Band 31** – Thermal infrared for surface temperature

Pixels are classified into:
- 🔥 Fire
- 🌊 Water
- ☁️ Cloud
- ❓ Unknown
- 🚫 Missing
- ❌ Non-fire

> 🔧 **Note:** NRT (Near Real-Time) data may contain minor spatial inaccuracies due to orbit estimation.
